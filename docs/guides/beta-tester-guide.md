# TotalReclaw -- Private Memory for Your AI Agent

**What it is:** Encrypted memory that works across sessions. Your AI remembers your preferences, decisions, and context -- and only you can read it. Not even our server sees your data.

**Works with:** OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, Cursor, NanoClaw, or any MCP-compatible agent.

---

## Quick Start

### OpenClaw (recommended -- fully automatic)

Ask your agent:

> "Install the totalreclaw plugin"

Or install manually via terminal:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @totalreclaw/totalreclaw
```

The agent handles the rest: it will ask if you have an existing recovery phrase or need a new one, set up encryption, and register you. Write down your 12-word recovery phrase -- that's the only thing you need to keep safe.

**After setup, memory is fully automatic:**
- Your agent remembers important things from conversations (preferences, decisions, facts)
- At the start of each conversation, relevant memories are loaded automatically
- You never need to tell your agent to "remember" anything -- it just does

You can always be explicit too -- "remember that I prefer dark mode" or "what do you remember about my project?" -- but it's not required.

### Claude Desktop / Cursor / Other MCP Agents

1. Run the setup wizard:
   ```bash
   npx @totalreclaw/mcp-server setup
   ```
   The wizard generates your recovery phrase, sets up encryption, registers you, and prints a config snippet to paste into your MCP client.

2. Paste the config snippet (the wizard tells you exactly where).

3. Start chatting. Your agent has memory tools it can use when appropriate.

**Note:** MCP agents don't have automatic memory like OpenClaw. The agent uses the tools when contextually appropriate, and you can also explicitly ask it to remember or recall things.

### NanoClaw

NanoClaw agents get TotalReclaw memory automatically — no setup required on your end. The NanoClaw admin adds a `TOTALRECLAW_MASTER_PASSWORD` secret for your group, and the agent-runner spawns `@totalreclaw/mcp-server` as a background process.

**What this means for you:**
- Your agent has 7 memory tools available: remember, recall, forget, export, import, status, upgrade (the OpenClaw plugin provides 5 of these — import and upgrade are MCP-only)
- Memory is shared within your NanoClaw group (same namespace = same memories)
- All data is encrypted with your group's master password before leaving the container
- Subgraph mode, billing, and quota work identically to Claude Desktop / Cursor

**To verify it's working**, ask your agent:

> "What's my TotalReclaw status?"

If TotalReclaw is configured, the agent will show your tier, usage, and storage mode.

**Recovery:** Your group's memory is tied to the `TOTALRECLAW_MASTER_PASSWORD`. If the admin changes it, previous memories become inaccessible. The admin should treat this password like a recovery phrase.

## How It Works

1. **You set up with a 12-word recovery phrase** (like a crypto wallet)
2. **All memories are encrypted on your device** before reaching our server
3. **The server only stores encrypted blobs** -- it can never read them
4. **Your data is anchored on-chain** (Gnosis Chain testnet) and indexed by The Graph — no single server controls your memories
5. **Same phrase on any device = same keys = same memories**

---

## What Gets Remembered

Your agent extracts and stores atomic facts from conversations:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Preference** | "User prefers TypeScript over JavaScript" |
| **Decision** | "User decided to use PostgreSQL for the main database" |
| **Fact** | "User works at Acme Corp" |
| **Goal** | "User wants to launch by Q2" |

Each fact is scored by importance. Low-importance facts decay over time; critical ones persist.

---

## Recovery & Multi-Device

Your 12-word recovery phrase is the only thing you need to access your memories from a new device or agent. Same phrase = same keys = same data.

**Write it down and store it safely.** If you lose it, your memories are unrecoverable -- that's the point of zero-knowledge encryption.

To recover: just run the setup again (OpenClaw: reinstall the skill; MCP: re-run the setup wizard) and enter your existing phrase when prompted. NanoClaw users: ask your group admin — recovery is managed via the group's master password.

## Storage Modes

TotalReclaw supports two storage modes:

| Mode | How It Works | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Subgraph (default)** | Encrypted facts are submitted on-chain (Gnosis Chain) via ERC-4337 and indexed by The Graph. Gas is sponsored — you pay nothing. | Default for all beta testers |
| **HTTP** | Encrypted facts are stored in the server's database. Faster, but centralized. | Set `TOTALRECLAW_SUBGRAPH_MODE=false` |

During beta, subgraph mode uses the Chiado testnet. Both modes encrypt your data identically — the difference is where the encrypted blobs are stored.

## Free Tier & Upgrading

| Tier | Writes | Reads | Price |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Free** | 100/month | Unlimited | $0 |
| **Pro** | 10,000/month | Unlimited | $2-5/month |

- Counter resets at the start of each calendar month
- Pay with card (Stripe) or crypto (Coinbase Commerce)
- When you hit the limit, your agent tells you and provides an upgrade link

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Setup not working | Re-run: `openclaw plugins install @totalreclaw/totalreclaw` or `npx @totalreclaw/mcp-server setup` |
| "Not authenticated" / 401 | Check your recovery phrase -- exact words, exact order |
| Memories not appearing | Try an explicit recall: "what do you remember about X?" |
| Quota exceeded (403) | Wait for monthly reset or upgrade to Pro |
| Want to test billing | Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any expiry/CVC |

## Known Limitations (Beta)

- Free tier limit (100 writes/month) and Pro pricing ($2-5/month) are not finalized
- MCP agents rely on explicit tool use rather than automatic memory hooks
- Beta runs on testnet infrastructure -- expect occasional downtime
- Subgraph mode (on-chain storage) is enabled by default when using a 12-word recovery phrase. Set `TOTALRECLAW_SUBGRAPH_MODE=false` to use HTTP-only mode

---

## Billing & Subscriptions (Beta)

Billing is in **test mode** during beta — no real charges. To test the upgrade flow:

**Test card numbers (Stripe test mode):**
| Card Number | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Successful payment |
| `4000 0000 0000 3220` | Requires 3D Secure authentication |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | Payment declined |

Use any future expiry date, any 3-digit CVC, and any billing address.

**Checking your subscription status:**
- **OpenClaw:** Ask your agent "What's my TotalReclaw subscription status?"
- **MCP agents:** The agent has a `status` tool that shows your tier, usage, and limits

**What happens at the quota limit:**
- Free tier: 100 writes/month, unlimited reads
- When you hit the limit, your agent will tell you and provide an upgrade link
- After upgrading (with a test card), writes resume immediately

**Monthly reset:** Usage counters reset at the start of each calendar month.
