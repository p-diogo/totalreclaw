/**
 * @title EventfulDataEdge
 * @notice Minimal data-availability contract for TotalReclaw.
 *
 * Any call to this contract (via fallback) emits a Log(bytes) event containing
 * the raw calldata. The subgraph indexes these events.
 *
 * Writes are permissionless — all payloads are AES-256-GCM encrypted, so there
 * is no confidentiality risk from open writes. The subgraph filters events by
 * the `owner` field in the protobuf payload, ensuring each user only sees their
 * own data. Billing/quota enforcement happens at the relay API layer.
 *
 * Design rationale:
 * - No storage slots — all data lives in events (cheapest on-chain DA).
 * - fallback() instead of a named function — saves ~200 gas on function selector.
 * - Single event type keeps subgraph mapping simple.
 *
 * Gas cost: ~1,200 base + 16 gas/non-zero-byte + 8 gas/zero-byte of calldata.
 * A typical 256-byte encrypted fact costs ~5,300 gas (~$0.0002 on Base L2).
