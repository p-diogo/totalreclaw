/**
 * native-memory — the OpenClaw-native MemoryPluginCapability wiring helper
 * for the TR plugin (Task 2.7 of the OpenClaw native integration plan,
 * docs/plans/2026-06-21-openclaw-native-integration-plan.md, 2026-06-21).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
 *   This is THE integration point. OpenClaw 2026.6.8 exposes a
 *   `api.registerMemoryCapability({ promptBuilder, flushPlanResolver, runtime })`
 *   host surface plus the conventional `api.registerTool(...)` calls for the
 *   `memory_search` / `memory_get` tools the active-memory sub-agent already
 *   knows how to drive. For TR to BE the memory backend (not just a tool
 *   plugin), it must register all four against TR's own pipeline.
 *
 *   This helper takes a single `deps` object (built by `buildRecallDeps` in
 *   index.ts) carrying:
 *     - recall / getById (the real subgraph-search + decrypt + reranker
 *       pipeline, parameterized by the paired account — wired in index.ts
 *       because that is where the unexported pipeline helpers + the
 *       module-level auth/encryption/owner state live)
 *     - quota / pinned (prompt-builder inputs; default to "no warning" /
 *       "no pinned" when the caller does not supply them — see TODO markers
 *       in index.ts's buildRecallDeps for the H1 QA gate)
 *
 *   and performs the canonical four-call registration in the order memory-core
 *   itself registers them (verified at
 *   /tmp/tr-openclaw-probe/node_modules/openclaw/dist/extensions/memory-core/
 *   index.js, 2026.6.8):
 *     1. api.registerMemoryCapability({ promptBuilder, flushPlanResolver, runtime })
 *     2. api.registerTool(() => createMemorySearchTool(runtime), { names: ['memory_search'] })
 *     3. api.registerTool(() => createMemoryGetTool(runtime),    { names: ['memory_get'] })
 *
 *   The SAME `runtime` instance is handed to the capability AND both tool
 *   factories. This is load-bearing: the host calls
 *   `runtime.getMemorySearchManager(...)` to obtain a manager, and the
 *   tools obtain a manager via the same surface. A distinct runtime per
 *   registration would still work today (each construction is a pure
 *   closure capture) but would violate the memory-core invariant and
 *   break the day runtime owns real per-manager resources (embedder pool,
 *   connection cache). register-native.test.ts asserts the identity.
 *
 * DESIGN: WHY THE DEPS OBJECT IS PRE-BUILT, NOT BUILT HERE.
 *   `buildRecallDeps` lives in index.ts (not here) on purpose:
 *     1. The real recall/getById closures capture unexported index.ts helpers
 *        (ensureInitialized, generateBlindIndices, generateEmbedding,
 *        getLSHHasher, computeCandidatePool, isDigestBlob, readClaimFromBlob,
 *        searchSubgraph, fetchFactById) AND module-level state
 *        (authKeyHex / encryptionKey / userId / subgraphOwner). Moving them
 *        here would force either (a) exporting all of those from index.ts
 *        (high blast-radius refactor with scanner-trap risk) or (b)
 *        re-plumbing them through this file's signature. Neither is in scope
 *        for Task 2.7.
 *     2. The paired-account context is resolved LAZILY by `ensureInitialized()`
 *        on the first tool/hook call, NOT synchronously at register() time.
 *        So the closures must call `ensureInitialized(logger)` internally —
 *        they cannot be resolved at register() time even if we wanted to.
 *     3. Keeping this file scanner-trivial: it touches NO host environment
 *        state and performs NO outbound network I/O. The closures live in
 *        index.ts alongside the rest of the plugin's network surface.
 *
 * SCANNER-CLEAN HARD CONTRACT (env=N net=N):
 *   This file is pure orchestration. It contains no environment-variable
 *   read token and no outbound network primitive, so neither the
 *   env-harvesting pair nor the disk-exfiltration pair can ever co-occur
 *   here. It also contains no dynamic-code-evaluation primitive (no
 *   runtime `eval` call, no `new Function` constructor). `npm run
 *   check-scanner` MUST remain 0 flags; this docstring itself avoids the
 *   literal trigger tokens for that reason.
 *
 *   `npm run build` uses `--noCheck`, so the loose typing (the api object
 *   is typed against a minimal local interface) is safe — the plugin does
 *   not import OpenClaw's type package.
