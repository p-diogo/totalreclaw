/**
 * credential-provider — credential source abstraction (cred-3 stage 1).
 *
 * The plugin needs to load its `CredentialsFile` (mnemonic + userId + salt +
 * scope_address) from one of two sources without per-deployment forks:
 *
 *   1. `file` — read/write `~/.totalreclaw/credentials.json` directly
 *      (legacy behavior; default).
 *   2. `external` — read from a secret manager that exposes the JSON as
 *      either an env var (Railway secrets, Docker `--env-file`, K8s
 *      `envFrom`) OR a mounted file path (Docker Compose `secrets:`,
 *      K8s secret volumeMount, tmpfs populated by an ops wrapper that
 *      pulls from a managed vault before plugin start).
 *
 * Stage 1 introduces the abstraction + integration test. Stage 2 routes
 * Hermes Python through the same surface; stage 3 routes MCP and ships a
 * concrete vault adapter. Plugin call sites are not yet rewired to go
 * through the provider — that's a follow-up so behavior under the default
 * `file` mode is byte-identical to today.
 *
 * Scanner constraints (see skill/scripts/check-scanner.mjs):
 *   - This file MUST avoid any subprocess module import. Both transport
 *     flavors here use `node:fs` only.
 *   - This file MUST avoid network-word substrings to keep the
 *     exfiltration rule quiet. All env reads are centralized in
 *     `config.ts`; we accept resolved values here.
 *
 * Phrase-safety:
 *   - The mnemonic is never logged from this file. Errors reference only
 *     transport names + sizes, never the raw payload.
 *   - File writes preserve mode `0o600` via the existing fs-helpers
 *     `writeCredentialsJson`.
 *   - `external` mode is read-only by design — the secret manager owns
 *     the source of truth; writing back would split it.

 *   - `clear()` deletes the credentials (used by `forceReinitialization`).
 *     Returns `false` for read-only providers.

 * first-run announcement is skipped in `external` mode because the
