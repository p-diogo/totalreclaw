/**
 * Per-channel inbound-user tracker (issue #215, 3.3.7-rc.1).
 *
 * Tier 3 + Tier 5 of the `/restart` 5-tier auth fallback need to know
 * "how many distinct users have ever messaged this gateway on channel X".
 *
 * This module implements a simple disk-backed counter. Persistence
 * survives gateway restarts (which is the whole point — a fresh
 * container restart must NOT reset the count to 0 and let an attacker
 * race the lone-user heuristic).
 *
 * Storage: a single JSON file at `<credentialsDir>/.inbound-users.json`
 * with shape `{ channel: { user1: ts, user2: ts, ... } }`. The file
 * sits next to credentials.json so it's covered by the same backup
 * boundary.
 *
 * Operations:
 *   - `recordInboundUser(channel, senderId)` — idempotent insert; updates
 *     `ts` to last-seen-at on every call.
 *   - `getDistinctInboundUserCount(channel)` — returns number of distinct
 *     keys for that channel (0 if no entries / file missing).
 *
 * Thread safety: the module-level cache is mutated synchronously in
 * one Node.js event-loop tick; concurrent message_received hooks share
 * the same cache. Disk writes are best-effort (no fsync) because losing
 * a few count updates is recoverable — the worst case is a stale-but-
 * never-stale count that becomes correct on the next inbound message.
 *
 * Privacy: senderIds are stored AS RECEIVED. Telegram chat IDs are not
 * secrets but they are user-identifying. The file is mode 0o600 (same
 * as credentials.json) so only the gateway's user can read it.
 *
 * Pure file I/O is intentional. The OpenClaw scanner whole-file rule
 * disallows fs.read* alongside outbound-request markers; we do not
 * make any HTTP / network call here, so the tracker is scanner-clean.
