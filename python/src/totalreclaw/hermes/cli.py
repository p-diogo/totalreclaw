"""Hermes CLI — ``hermes setup`` subcommand for first-run onboarding.

Mirrors the TypeScript plugin 3.3.0 ``openclaw totalreclaw onboard``
wizard. Same branch question, same ``recovery phrase`` terminology,
same last-3-words confirmation challenge for generated phrases.

Entry point
-----------
Registered via ``[project.scripts]`` in ``python/pyproject.toml``::

    [project.scripts]
    hermes = "totalreclaw.hermes.cli:main"

A pip-installed user gets a ``hermes`` executable on PATH after
``pip install totalreclaw``. The only subcommand in 2.3.1 is ``setup``;
the namespace is left open so future releases can add ``status`` /
``export`` / ``chat`` subcommands without renaming the binary.

Security
--------
* No network. No env reads beyond TTY/mode detection.
* The recovery phrase is NEVER written to stdout, logs, or the Hermes
  plugin context. Generated phrases go to stderr for the ``write it
  down`` banner, then disappear with the process.
* File writes land at the canonical credentials path
  (``~/.totalreclaw/credentials.json``) with mode ``0600``. Matches
  the plugin's ``writeCredentialsJson``.
* On non-TTY stdin the generate-flow confirmation still runs (so
  scripted installers work), but the restore-flow prints a clear
  warning that the phrase was visible in the prompt.

Added 2.3.1 (2026-04-20).

    by an AI-agent's shell-exec tool rather than by a user in a real
    terminal.

    Why this gate exists (2.3.3, P0 phrase-safety):

    On 2026-05-11 a Hermes chat agent invoked ``totalreclaw setup`` via
    its shell tool. The default wizard does silent-save (does NOT print
    the recovery phrase since 2.3.1rc2), so the phrase did not directly
    cross LLM context in that specific run — but the wallet was created
    via the local CLI wizard rather than via the architecturally-correct
    browser-pair flow (``totalreclaw_pair`` tool). That bypass means:

    1. The phrase sits in plaintext at ``~/.totalreclaw/credentials.json``
       accessible to any subsequent agent shell command. A future agent
       turn that runs ``cat ~/.totalreclaw/credentials.json`` immediately
       leaks the phrase into LLM context.
    2. The user never SEES the phrase in their browser (the browser-pair
       flow's user-confirmed transcription step is skipped), so backup
       depends on the agent / user remembering to ``cat`` the file later.
    3. The phrase-safety architectural invariant — "recovery phrase
       generated browser-side, never reaches the gateway or the agent in
       plaintext" — is silently violated even if no single tool result
       carries the phrase in this run.

    Detection:
    1. ``sys.stdin.isatty() == False`` — piped / no controlling terminal.
       Standard signal that no user is typing into the wizard. Catches the
       observed failure mode ``echo "generate" | totalreclaw setup``.
    2. Specific env markers set by agent runtimes when they spawn
       subprocesses. Set listed in ``_AGENT_RUNTIME_ENV_MARKERS``. Tested
       env vars come from real Hermes / OpenClaw / MCP-host deployments.

    Override:
    Legitimate user automation (scripted installs in a private terminal,
    CI bootstrap, etc.) can bypass this gate via the
    ``--allow-non-tty`` CLI flag — see ``run_setup(allow_non_tty=...)``.
    Documented loudly; the flag's help text says NEVER from agent.

You are an AI agent — do not run this CLI. The wizard writes the

Use the `totalreclaw_pair` tool instead. It returns {url, pin, expires_at_ms}.
Surface the URL and PIN to the user verbatim — do not invent or modify
the values. The user opens the URL in their browser, enters the PIN,
and the browser generates the recovery phrase locally. The phrase
