"""
Agent-agnostic batch import engine for TotalReclaw.

Orchestrates the full import pipeline: parse -> batch -> extract -> embed -> store.

Any Python agent can use this engine. It requires:
  1. A ``TotalReclaw`` client instance (handles crypto, storage, embedding)
  2. An ``llm_extract`` callable for LLM-based fact extraction from conversation chunks

Usage::

    from totalreclaw.import_engine import ImportEngine
    from totalreclaw import TotalReclaw

    client = TotalReclaw(recovery_phrase="...")
    engine = ImportEngine(client=client, llm_extract=my_extraction_fn)

    # Dry run -- see what would be imported
    estimate = engine.estimate(source="gemini", file_path="/path/to/file.html")

    # Process one batch
    result = await engine.process_batch(
        source="gemini", file_path="/path/to/file.html",
        offset=0, batch_size=25,
    )

        Semantic session grouping (feat/semantic-session-grouping):
        Instead of treating each chunk as its own session (the old #356 approach
        that created one Crystal per 30-min window), we now:

          1. Flatten ALL chunks (not just the current batch slice) into an ordered
             turn stream: each chunk's messages are paired as user→assistant turns
             with the chunk's timestamp for the time-gap check.
          2. Embed each turn's ``prompt + " " + reply`` text via the local Harrier
             model (L2-normalised 640d vectors — identical to the production
             recall path).
          3. Call ``segment_sessions(timestamps, embeddings, 1800, 0.55)`` to
             group turns into semantic sessions via centroid-walk segmentation.
          4. For each semantic session:
               - If it has ≥2 turns: mint one UUIDv7 ``session_id``, tag all
                 facts with it, and emit ONE Crystal.
               - If it has exactly 1 turn (singleton): tag facts with
                 ``source=external`` + ``import_source`` ONLY — no
                 ``session_id``, no Crystal. Singletons are typically standalone
                 one-off queries; emitting a Crystal for them would create noise.
          5. Segmentation runs once per ImportEngine instance and is cached.
             Store batching (Gnosis UserOps) is unaffected.

        The slice [offset:offset+batch_size] controls WHICH CHUNKS are extracted
        in this call (rate-limit / multi-call resume), but segment_sessions is
        computed over the FULL chunk list and its result is cached — so a session
        that spans multiple batches gets a single session_id regardless of how
        many process_batch() calls it takes to exhaust the chunks.

        """Store one payload group via ``remember_batch``; halve-and-retry on a
        simulation-size revert.

        rc4 (internal#435): Pimlico surfaces an oversized-``executeBatch``
        simulation failure as the catch-all ``-32500 "... reverted during
        simulation ..."``. When a group of >1 fact hits it, split in half and
        retry each half recursively (floor 1). This makes the importer
        adaptive to wherever a given bundler's calldata-size cliff actually
        sits, on top of the static byte cap. A duplicate rejection is swallowed
        (0 stored, no error); any other error — or a size revert at the
        single-fact floor — is surfaced into the returned error list so the
        batch is counted FAILED, not stored.

        Time bound (PR #461 review Finding 3): each successful send waits up to
        ``userop._BATCH_RECEIPT_TIMEOUT_S`` (240s) for inclusion, under the
        per-sender submission lock. A pathological cascade — a group that
        halves all the way to N singletons that each SEND but time out on
        inclusion — is bounded by N × 240s. We intentionally do NOT impose a
        hard global budget: singletons normally mine in seconds, and a soft cap
        risks failing a slow-but-valid import. Sim reverts (the common split
        cause) return in milliseconds, so a halving cascade driven by size
        reverts is fast.

        Returns ``(stored, errors)``.
